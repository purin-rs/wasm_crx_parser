## Step 8: Test with a real CRX file
You can obtain a Chrome extension (.crx file) by downloading one from the Chrome Web Store or by packaging your own extension in developer mode.
## Step 9 (Optional): Enhance the parser
For a production-ready parser, consider these enhancements:
1. Add proper support for CRX3 format using a protocol buffer library
2. Implement ZIP extraction functionality
3. Add validation of the extension signature
4. Implement a streaming parser for handling large files

## Conclusion
You've now created a basic CRX parser in WebAssembly using Rust that can:
- Parse the CRX header
- Extract metadata (version, public key, signature)
- Extract the ZIP content

This implementation provides a foundation that you can build upon for more advanced functionality.
